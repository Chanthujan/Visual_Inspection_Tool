Visual Inspection Tool for Earthquake Ground Motion Processing
Overview
This Visual Inspection Tool is designed for the analysis of seismic data for Earthquake Data Analysis. It provides a detailed and interactive interface for visualizing and inspecting the seismic waveforms captured by ground motion sensors. Developed by the CRISiSLab team at Massey University, this tool is crucial for enhancing the reliability of P-wave and S-wave picks in earthquake research and early warning applications.

Features
Waveform Visualization: Displays four distinct plots for each seismic record. These include:

Vertical acceleration record with P and S-wave picks marked.
Enlarged view of the vertical acceleration focusing on the initial P-wave arrival.
Horizontal acceleration records in both east and north components with S-wave picks.
Interactive Interface: Allows users to interact with the data, zoom into specific sections, and manually verify or adjust wave picks.

Data Filtering: Includes tools to filter out erroneous records and ensure that only high-quality data is used for analysis.
